# cloudify
You give me a web page, I give you a word cloud.

A .NET MVC application which generates a word cloud of the 30 most occurring words with greater than 4 characters from a website at a url.

To set up the application, you need to build the visual studio solution and perform a bower install in the main website directory. To run bower you will need to install node.js first. Otherwise that's it.
